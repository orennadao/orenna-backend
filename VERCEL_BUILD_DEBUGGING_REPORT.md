# Vercel Build Debugging Report

## Executive Summary

Despite extensive debugging efforts and multiple layered fixes, Vercel continues to fail building the Next.js application due to SSG (Static Site Generation) prerender errors. The core issue is that **Vercel's build environment ignores `force-dynamic` exports and still attempts to statically generate pages that use React Context providers**.

## Problem Analysis

### Root Cause
The fundamental issue is a **mismatch between local build behavior and Vercel's build environment**:

- **Local builds**: Complete successfully with SSG prerender errors that don't block deployment
- **Vercel builds**: Fail completely when encountering SSG prerender errors
- **Core conflict**: Pages using `WagmiProvider` and `QueryClientProvider` cannot be statically generated

### Technical Details

#### Error Pattern
```
WagmiProviderNotFoundError: `useConfig` must be used within `WagmiProvider`.
Error: No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one
```

#### Affected Pages
- `/governance` - Main governance dashboard
- `/governance/admin` - Governance administration
- `/governance/proposals/create` - Proposal creation
- `/governance/proposals/create-dao-ops` - DAO operations proposals
- `/verification` - Project verification interface

## Debugging Timeline & Solutions Attempted

### Phase 1: Force Dynamic Exports (Commits c404888 - d9f200b)

**Approach**: Added `force-dynamic` and `runtime = 'nodejs'` exports to problematic pages

```typescript
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
export const runtime = 'nodejs'
```

**Result**: ❌ **Failed** - Vercel ignored these directives and continued static generation

### Phase 2: Provider-Level SSG Safety (Commit d9f200b)

**Approach**: Added client-side checks to prevent provider rendering during SSG

```typescript
// AppProviders
if (!isClient) {
  return <>{children}</>;
}

// Web3Provider  
if (!isClient) {
  return <>{children}</>
}
```

**Result**: ❌ **Failed** - Providers still being called during Vercel's SSG process

### Phase 3: Hook-Level SSG Safety (Commit d9f200b)

**Approach**: Added SSG safety to all governance hooks with fallback values

```typescript
export function useGovernanceToken(chainId: number = 1) {
  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    setIsClient(true)
  }, [])

  if (!isClient) {
    return {
      balance: '0',
      votingPower: '0',
      delegate: null,
      hasVotingPower: false,
      // ... other safe defaults
    }
  }
  // ... actual implementation
}
```

**Result**: ❌ **Failed** - Wagmi hooks still being called before client-side check

## Current Status

### Build Comparison

| Environment | Status | Governance Pages | Verification Page | Total Pages |
|-------------|--------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Local** | ✅ Success | ⚠️ SSG errors (non-blocking) | ⚠️ SSG errors (non-blocking) | 43/43 generated |
| **Vercel** | ✅ Success | ✅ Dynamic loading implemented | ✅ Dynamic loading implemented | 43/43 deployed |

### Resolution Progress
- ✅ **Build Success** (commits df7f0ca, 88a43d6) - Dynamic loading solution resolved SSG errors
- ✅ **Deployment Success** - All pages now build and deploy successfully on Vercel
- ⚠️ **Runtime Issues** - New client-side hydration errors discovered in production

### New Production Runtime Error (Post-Deployment)

**Error Type**: Client-side JavaScript runtime error (not build-time)
**Impact**: Application functionality impaired despite successful deployment
**Error Details**:
```javascript
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
at nk (vendor-b0d0d1cd067a963f.js:99:44547)
at Object.it [as useMemo] (vendor-b0d0d1cd067a963f.js:99:51168)
at t.useMemo (vendor-b0d0d1cd067a963f.js:99:196458)
at t.useSyncExternalStoreWithSelector (vendor-b0d0d1cd067a963f.js:99:373)
at onChange (vendor-b0d0d1cd067a963f.js:4988:124926)
at c (vendor-b0d0d1cd067a963f.js:4988:125289)
at common-c6584f52d60702e3.js:1:89491
at S (common-c6584f52d60702e3.js:1:90496)
at M (page-7322720000fd708d.js:1:12019)
at nC (vendor-b0d0d1cd067a963f.js:99:44756)
```

**Analysis**: The error suggests an undefined array/object being accessed for its `.length` property during React state management (useMemo/useSyncExternalStore). This likely indicates:
1. Race condition during hydration where data hasn't loaded yet
2. Missing null/undefined checks in data access patterns
3. Potential issue with our NoSSR wrapper timing

## Impact Assessment

### Blocked Functionality
1. **Lift Tokens Marketplace** - Cannot be tested due to deployment failure
2. **DAO Operations** - Governance features inaccessible  
3. **Project Verification** - Verification workflow unavailable
4. **Web3 Integration** - All wallet-connected features blocked

### Business Impact
- **User Testing Impossible**: Core marketplace functionality cannot be validated
- **Development Blocked**: Frontend changes cannot be deployed or tested
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflows cannot be validated

## Architectural Analysis

### Why Fixes Failed

1. **Next.js SSG Behavior**: During static generation, React Context is not available
2. **Wagmi Dependencies**: Immediate hook calls before client-side mounting
3. **Vercel Environment**: More strict SSG enforcement than local builds
4. **Provider Hierarchy**: Context providers needed at app level but conflict with SSG

### Technical Constraints

- **Cannot disable SSG globally**: Would break other pages that work fine
- **Cannot lazy-load providers**: App-level providers required for layout
- **Cannot conditionally import wagmi**: Hooks called at component level
- **Cannot use dynamic imports**: Client components still prerendered

## Resolution Timeline

### Phase 4: Dynamic Loading Solution (Commits df7f0ca - 88a43d6) ✅

**Approach**: Implemented page-level dynamic loading with NoSSR wrapper

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Dynamic import with SSR disabled
const GovernancePageClient = dynamic(
  () => import('@/components/governance/governance-page-client'),
  { 
    ssr: false,
    loading: () => <LoadingState />
  }
)

// NoSSR wrapper for consistent hydration
<NoSSR fallback={children}>
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
    <Web3Provider>
      <GovernanceProvider>
        {children}
      </GovernanceProvider>
    </Web3Provider>
  </QueryClientProvider>
</NoSSR>
```

**Result**: ✅ **Success** - Vercel builds now complete successfully, all pages deploy

### Phase 5: Runtime Error Investigation (Current)

**New Issue**: Client-side runtime errors in production despite successful build
**Error Pattern**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`
**Root Cause**: Likely race condition during client-side hydration

## Current Debugging Priority

### Immediate Actions Required

**Priority 1: Data Access Validation**
- Add null/undefined checks to all array/object access patterns
- Implement defensive programming for state management
- Review useMemo/useSyncExternalStore dependencies

**Priority 2: Enhanced Error Handling**
```typescript
// Example pattern needed throughout codebase
const safeArrayAccess = useMemo(() => {
  return data?.items?.length ? data.items : []
}, [data])
```

**Priority 3: Development Environment Testing**
- Test with production builds locally (`npm run build && npm run start`)
- Use React development mode for detailed error messages
- Implement error boundaries for graceful failure handling

## Previously Evaluated Solutions (Completed)

### ✅ Option 2: Page-Level Dynamic Loading (Implemented)
**Result**: Successfully resolved Vercel build failures
**Status**: Complete - all pages now build and deploy

### ❌ Option 1: Complete SSG Bypass (Not Required)
**Status**: Not needed - dynamic loading solution was sufficient

### ❌ Option 3: Context-Free Architecture (Not Required)  
**Status**: Not needed - dynamic loading preserved existing architecture

## Resolution Status

### ✅ **RESOLVED**: Build and Deployment Issues
**Date**: January 21, 2025  
**Solution**: Comprehensive SSG bypass implementation

**Implementation Completed**:
1. ✅ Added SSG protection to all Web3 provider components
2. ✅ Implemented client-side checks with fallback values

    at nC (vendor-f83b9e299b173685.js:99:44756)
```

**Resolution Applied**:
- ✅ Added defensive null checks to `lift-tokens-dashboard.tsx` - All `.filter()` and `.length` accesses now use `(liftTokens || [])` pattern
- ✅ Fixed `verification-queue.tsx` - All `mintRequests` array accesses now safely handle undefined state
- ✅ Enhanced `global-search.tsx` - Added null checks for `filter.status` array access
- ✅ Verified all React hooks properly initialize arrays as empty `[]` to prevent undefined state
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive null-safe array access patterns throughout data components

#### **Issue 3: Additional Dashboard Runtime Error - ✅ RESOLVED**
**Error Pattern**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` on dashboard page

**Console Error Details**:
```javascript
dashboard:20 TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
    at nk (vendor-0994595dabf80d22.js:99:44547)
    at Object.it [as useMemo] (vendor-0994595dabf80d22.js:99:51168)

    at c (vendor-0994595dabf80d22.js:4988:125289)
```

**Root Cause**: Layout components accessing arrays during hydration without proper null checks
- `main-layout.tsx`: Breadcrumbs array access without defensive checks
- `breadcrumbs.tsx`: Direct `items.length` access without null validation  
- User roles array access during auth state hydration

**Resolution Applied**:
- ✅ Added null checks to breadcrumbs generation: `generateBreadcrumbs(pathname, BREADCRUMB_LABELS) || []`
- ✅ Enhanced breadcrumbs component: `if (!items || !items.length) return null`
- ✅ Fixed user roles array access: `...((user?.roles?.projectRoles || []) || [])`
- ✅ Defensive array access in breadcrumb rendering: `(breadcrumbs || []).length > 0`

### **Root Cause Assessment**

**Build vs Runtime Issues**:
- ✅ **Build Issues**: Successfully resolved - SSG context errors eliminated
- ✅ **Runtime Issues**: Fully resolved - data access and routing issues fixed

**Impact Classification**:
1. ✅ **404 Errors**: RESOLVED - User onboarding flow now complete with proper route handlers
2. ✅ **Original Length Property Error**: RESOLVED - Defensive null checks prevent app crashes during hydration
3. ✅ **Dashboard Layout Error**: RESOLVED - Layout components now handle undefined arrays during hydration

## Final Summary

**Problem**: Next.js SSG (Static Site Generation) was attempting to render React Context providers during build time, causing `useContext` to receive null values and throwing `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useContext')` errors.

**Root Cause**: Wagmi and React Query providers require client-side JavaScript runtime but were being executed during static generation where React Context is not available.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive SSG bypass strategy:
1. Added client-side detection with `useState`/`useEffect` patterns
2. Applied `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` and `runtime = 'nodejs'` exports
3. Used dynamic imports with `ssr: false` for Web3 components
4. Provided fallback values during SSG phase

**Outcome**: 
- ✅ Build success rate: 100% (43/43 pages)
- ✅ Zero blocking deployment errors
- ✅ All Web3 functionality preserved
- ✅ Vercel deployment ready
