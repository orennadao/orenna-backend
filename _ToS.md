Perfect — here’s a **draft Terms of Service** for Orenna. It’s written in plain but formal legal language, designed for display during onboarding (checkbox acceptance required). I’ve kept it comprehensive but not overwhelming — you can shorten or expand sections depending on how prominent you want the disclaimers to be.

Would you like me to **also draft a shorter, plain-English “Quick Summary” version** of this ToS (something like a sidebar/tooltip in the onboarding flow), so new users don’t just skip over it? That can help with clarity and user trust.
