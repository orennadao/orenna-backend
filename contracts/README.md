# Lift Forward Contracts - COMPLETE ✅

Successfully implemented PR1 with a complete, tested smart contract system for regenerative finance.

## ✅ What We Built

### **Core Contracts:**
1. **MethodRegistry** - Governance for ecosystem measurement methods
2. **LiftTokens** - ERC-1155 tokens representing verified ecosystem improvements  
3. **RepaymentEscrow** - Dual-cap repayment waterfall (funder + platform fee caps)
4. **AllocationEscrow** - Market Allocation Window management (ready for integration)

### **Key Features Implemented:**
- ✅ **Role-based access control** with proper separation of duties
- ✅ **EIP-712 signature verification** for verified issuance
- ✅ **Issuance band system** (target/min/max units with determinable-at-settlement)
- ✅ **Dual-cap economics** (no yield to funders + platform fee caps)
- ✅ **Method versioning & governance** (technical committee + DAO approval)
- ✅ **Comprehensive test suite** (14 tests passing)
- ✅ **Production deployment script**

### **Integration Ready:**
- Database events → Contract events alignment
- Environment variables → Contract addresses  
- API routes → Contract function mapping
- Hamilton allocator → Merkle proof system
- Existing blockchain service → Extended functionality

## 🚀 Next Steps (PR2):

1. **Export ABIs** to `packages/abi/` 
2. **Deploy to testnet** and get contract addresses
3. **Extend blockchain service** with new contract interactions
4. **Add database models** for MAW and repayment tracking
5. **Implement `/forwards/*` API routes**
6. **Add webhook payment processing**
7. **Build event indexing** for real-time updates
