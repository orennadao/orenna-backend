1. Getting Started

What is Orenna?
Orenna is a decentralized platform connecting land stewards, restoration professionals, and mission-aligned funders. We use blockchain technology to make ecological restoration transparent, verifiable, and financially sustainable.

Key concepts:

Lift Tokens (ERC-1155): Digital representations of verified ecological lift (improved ecosystem function).

Lift Forwards: Forward purchase agreements that fund restoration work before ecological lift is fully realized.

Project NFTs: Digital containers that hold and organize Lift Tokens and Forwards for each restoration project.

Governance Token (ERC-20): Enables community decision-making on protocol changes and strategy.

2. Creating an Account

Connect a Wallet: Use MetaMask or another supported wallet to create an Orenna account.

Sign In with Ethereum (SIWE): We use SIWE authentication for secure, Web3-native login.

Profile Setup: Add optional details like your organization, role (landowner, funder, professional), and interests.

3. Participating in Projects

Browse Projects: Explore active ecological restoration projects on the dashboard.

Fund a Project: Purchase Lift Forwards to support implementation.

Track Progress: Each project has a transparent record of milestones, budgets, and ecological metrics.

Claim Lift: Once verified, Lift Tokens can be retired (to claim ecological outcomes) or transferred.

4. Governance & Community

Vote with Governance Tokens: Token holders can submit and vote on proposals affecting protocol rules, project eligibility, and treasury use.

DAO Participation: Join working groups (Design, Implementation, Tokenomics, Legal, etc.) to shape Orenna‚Äôs direction.

Transparency: All proposals, discussions, and outcomes are stored on-chain and accessible through the governance portal.

5. Verification & Standards

Independent Verifiers: Third-party ecologists and AI-augmented tools ensure that ecological lift claims are accurate.

Lift Standard: Orenna‚Äôs open-source protocol defines how lift is measured and tokenized.

Public Registry: All Lift Tokens and project details are visible on-chain, ensuring accountability.

6. Security & Trust

Smart Contracts: Escrow and payments are governed by audited smart contracts.

Data Privacy: Only essential information is stored on-chain.

Mission Alignment: We prioritize funders and partners aligned with ecological restoration, not extractive speculation.

7. FAQ

Can I sell Lift Tokens?
Yes. Lift Tokens can be transferred or sold before retirement, but retirement is required to ‚Äúclaim‚Äù ecological outcomes.

What if a project fails?
Funds are released through milestone-based escrow. If a project fails early, unspent funds may be returned or redirected by DAO vote.

How are projects selected?
Projects are proposed by landowners or restoration professionals, reviewed by the DAO, and must meet the Lift Standard.
