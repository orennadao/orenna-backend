# Performance Optimization Guide

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Orenna DAO web application.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Code Splitting and Dynamic Imports

- **Route-level splitting**: Each page is automatically split by Next.js
- **Component-level splitting**: Heavy components (charts, analytics) are lazy-loaded
- **Bundle analysis**: Run `npm run build:analyze` to analyze bundle sizes

### 2. Caching Strategies

#### Browser Caching
- Static assets: 1 year cache with immutable flag
- API responses: 5 minutes cache with stale-while-revalidate
- Service Worker: Implements cache-first for assets, network-first for API calls

#### Application Caching
- API response caching with TTL and stale-while-revalidate
- Automatic cache invalidation on mutations
- Memory-efficient cache with size limits

### 3. Image Optimization

- Next.js Image component with WebP/AVIF support
- Lazy loading with intersection observer
- Blur placeholders and error handling
- Optimized avatar components

### 4. Service Worker Features

- Asset caching for offline functionality
- Background sync for delayed operations
- Push notifications support
- Network failure fallbacks

### 5. Performance Monitoring

- Web Vitals tracking (LCP, FID, CLS, FCP, TTFB)
- Bundle size monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Performance budget enforcement

## Performance Budgets

The application enforces the following performance budgets:

- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: < 2 seconds
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 4 seconds
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: < 100ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: < 800ms

## Build Commands

```bash
# Regular build
npm run build

# Build with bundle analysis
npm run build:analyze

# Development with performance monitoring
npm run dev
```

## Cache Management

### API Cache
- Default TTL: 5 minutes
- Stale-while-revalidate: Enabled
- Size limit: 100 entries
- Automatic cleanup: Every 10 minutes

### Service Worker Cache
- Static assets: Long-term caching
- API responses: Short-term caching
- Offline fallbacks: Available

## Monitoring

### Web Vitals
The application automatically tracks and reports Core Web Vitals:
- Data is logged to console in development
- Sent to Google Analytics in production

### Bundle Size
- JavaScript bundles are monitored
- Size breakdown available in build analysis
- Automatic alerts for large bundles

### Memory Usage
- Heap size monitoring in supported browsers
- Alerts for memory leaks
- Regular garbage collection monitoring

## Best Practices

### Code Splitting
1. Use `React.lazy()` for heavy components
2. Implement proper loading states
3. Group related functionality in chunks

### Caching
1. Cache GET requests by default
2. Invalidate cache on mutations
3. Use stale-while-revalidate for better UX

### Images
1. Use `OptimizedImage` component
2. Implement lazy loading for below-fold images
3. Provide fallbacks for failed loads

### Performance
1. Monitor Web Vitals regularly
2. Run bundle analysis before releases
3. Test on slow networks and devices

## Troubleshooting

### Slow Load Times
1. Check bundle analysis for large chunks
2. Verify cache headers are set correctly
3. Monitor network requests in DevTools

### High Memory Usage
1. Check for memory leaks in components
2. Verify cache cleanup is working
3. Monitor heavy operations in analytics

### Cache Issues
1. Clear browser cache manually
2. Check service worker registration
3. Verify cache invalidation logic

## Future Optimizations

- Implement HTTP/2 server push
- Add resource hints (preload, prefetch)
- Optimize font loading strategies
- Implement progressive enhancement
- Add image compression pipeline
