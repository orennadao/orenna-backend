# Orenna Governance Framework

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the governance framework for the Orenna ecosystem, establishing the policies, procedures, and parameters that guide decentralized decision-making for environmental impact verification and carbon credit platforms.

<Callout type="info" title="Living Document">
This governance framework is designed to evolve with the ecosystem. Regular reviews and updates ensure the governance system remains effective and aligned with community needs.
</Callout>

## 2. Governance Scope

The Orenna governance system oversees:

- **Platform Parameters**: Technical configurations and operational thresholds
- **Verification Standards**: Methodologies for environmental impact measurement
- **Treasury Management**: Allocation of community funds and resources
- **Protocol Upgrades**: Updates to smart contracts and system architecture
- **Partnership Approvals**: Integration with external verification bodies and carbon markets

## 3. Proposal Types & Parameters

The governance system recognizes three main categories of proposals, each with distinct requirements:

<GovParamTable />

### 3.1 Standard Proposals
Standard proposals address routine governance matters including:
- Minor parameter adjustments
- Community initiatives and grants
- Non-critical protocol updates
- Ecosystem partnership approvals

### 3.2 Major Proposals
Major proposals involve significant changes with substantial impact:
- Treasury allocations exceeding $100,000 USD
- Core protocol modifications
- Changes to verification methodologies
- Strategic partnership agreements

### 3.3 Emergency Proposals
Emergency proposals address urgent matters requiring expedited action:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Critical system failures
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Market instability responses

## 4. Participation Requirements

### 4.1 Token Holdings
Participation in governance requires holding ORNA tokens, which represent voting power proportional to stake in the ecosystem. Token holders may participate through:

- **Direct Voting**: Personal participation in governance decisions
- **Delegation**: Appointing representatives to vote on their behalf
- **Proposal Submission**: Creating new governance proposals

### 4.2 Delegation System
The delegation system enables efficient governance participation:

- Token holders may delegate voting power to any Ethereum address
- Delegation is reversible at any time without penalty
- Delegates may re-delegate to other addresses
- Self-delegation is required to participate in voting directly

### 4.3 Proposal Submission
Any token holder meeting the minimum sponsorship requirements may submit proposals. Sponsorship requirements vary by proposal type and ensure community support before formal voting begins.

## 5. Voting Process

### 5.1 Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Drafting Phase**
   - Community discussion and proposal refinement
   - Feedback collection and iteration
   - Technical feasibility assessment

2. **Sponsorship Phase**
   - Gathering required token holder support
   - Verification of sponsorship thresholds
   - Final proposal preparation

3. **Voting Period**
   - Active voting by eligible participants
   - Real-time vote tracking and transparency
   - Community discussion and analysis

4. **Execution Phase**
   - Implementation of approved proposals
   - Progress monitoring and reporting
   - Community feedback collection

### 5.2 Voting Methods

- **Simple Majority**: Standard proposals require >50.01% approval
- **Supermajority**: Major changes require 66.67% approval
- **Emergency Procedures**: Expedited voting with 60% threshold

### 5.3 Quorum Requirements

All proposals must meet minimum participation thresholds to ensure legitimacy:
- Standard: 8% of total voting power
- Major: 15% of total voting power  
- Emergency: 5% of total voting power

## 6. Implementation & Enforcement

### 6.1 Execution Mechanisms
Approved proposals are implemented through:

- **On-chain Execution**: Smart contract changes via timelock mechanisms
- **Off-chain Coordination**: Development team coordination for infrastructure updates
- **Community Implementation**: Volunteer-driven initiatives and programs

### 6.2 Timelock Security
All on-chain changes include mandatory timelock periods:
- Standard proposals: 48-hour delay
- Major proposals: 72-hour delay
- Emergency proposals: 12-hour delay

### 6.3 Monitoring & Compliance
The community maintains oversight through:
- Regular progress reporting
- Public audit mechanisms  
- Transparency requirements
- Accountability measures

## 7. Governance Risks & Safeguards

    title: "Voter Apathy and Low Participation",
    risk: "Insufficient community engagement may lead to decisions made by a small subset of token holders, potentially compromising the democratic nature of governance.",
