📝 Quick Summary of Orenna Terms

We’ve kept the legal details in the full Terms of Service, but here’s what it really means for you:

✅ What Orenna Is

A community-run platform funding ecological restoration.

Different blockchain okens represent governance rights (voting power) and ecological lift outcomes (restoration benefits).

Orenna is not an investment scheme — tokens are about restoring ecosystems, not financial returns.

⚖️ Your Role

You must be 18+ and in a place where this is legal.

You control your wallet and private keys — we can’t recover them if lost!

You agree to follow DAO rules and governance decisions, even if you disagree with the outcome.

⚠️ Risks You Should Know

Smart contract bugs or hacks could cause loss of tokens.

Token values can change or become unsellable.

Laws may change and affect participation.

Restoration projects are real-world efforts, and ecological results can’t be guaranteed.

❌ No Guarantees

We don’t promise profits, outcomes, or uninterrupted service.

If something goes wrong, your only option is to stop using the platform.

📍 Legal Stuff

Orenna is organized as a Wyoming DAO LLC.

Disputes are handled under Wyoming law, usually by arbitration.
